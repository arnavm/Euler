# first_divisor and second_divisor must be mutually prime

# Sum up all integers from 0 to the quotient, relying on the
# fact that âˆ‘ of the first n integers = (n)(n+1)/2
# Then, multiply by the divisors to get sum of all multiples
first_sum = (first_divisor) * (first_quotient) * (first_quotient + 1)/2
second_sum = (second_divisor) * (second_quotient) * (second_quotient + 1)/2
joint_sum = (first_divisor * second_divisor) * (joint_quotient) * (joint_quotient + 1)/2

# Calculate total using inclusion-exclusion principle:
# union(A, B) = A + B - intersection(A, B)

total = first_sum + second_sum - joint_sum
